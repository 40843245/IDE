# java.lang.ClassNotFoundException
## Major reason

Kotlin_v9Kt.class does NOT build successfully.

Why it does NOT build successfully at compile time?

There are lots of reasons:

1.  Either missing or wrong settings about Kotlin Compiler. It possibly may cause the jdk NOT found at compile time.
2.  Either missing or wrong settings about Java -> Build Path.

## Example of Compiler Error

    Error: Could not find or load main class Kotlin_v9Kt
    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Kotlin_v9Kt

## solution
When 1. 2. is the reason which cause the issue, we can set the preferences. 

step 1:

select
        
        Navigation bar -> Preferences 

step 2: 

select 
    
      Kotlin -> Compiler (for Kotlin Compiler)
      Java -> Build path (for Java Build path)
